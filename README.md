# LunchOverflow

Who are we:
We are Brian Borges, Daniel Rodriguez, Kevin Kwon, and Carl Schubert.

Our Concept:
New students at dbc are often also new to the financial district.  It is not immediately obvious where to get lunch.  We are making a website where users can post restaurants in the area of dbc.  Other users can upvote and downvote those post as well as comment on them in order to make it easier for new students to find places eat.
